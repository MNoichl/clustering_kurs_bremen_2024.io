Hello, and welcome to the website for our course on **conteporary solutions for clustering and data-visualisation** for social scientists.
During and after the course you will be able to access all the course materials on this website. 

**Note:** This course will make use of colab-notebooks, so that we all can start of working in the same interacive python-environment. All you have to do in order to start of with this on Monday is have an active google-account. If you have a moment, you can verify that everything works, and familiarize yourself with the colab-environment in [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/CODINGinK12/blob/master/notebooks/intro.ipynb).

Looking forward to a great course! – **MN**
